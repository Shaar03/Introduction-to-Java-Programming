(Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month into
a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%. Thus, the monthly interest
rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account becomes
100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
After the second month, the value in the account becomes
(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
After the third month, the value in the account becomes
(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
and so on.
