(Health application: computing BMI) Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of
health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing,
by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to
enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. Note one pound
is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters.
