(Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplane’s acceleration a and take-off
speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
take off using the following formula:
length = v^2 / 2a
Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and
the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s^2), then, displays the minimum
runway length.
